# VeldridView

This project is a sample set up of [Veldrid](https://github.com/mellinoe/veldrid) package for use in Xamarin Forms. 
It defines VeldridView which is a `VeldridViewPanel` which is a View for use in Xamarin Forms.

An`IApplicationWindow` is defined separately and passed as argument to it.

Since this is a proof of concept, the application itself creates a colored quad in the center of the view and background color is chosen at random each frame.
